# 📝 TODO List

## 🚀 Go
- **Self Updater**
  _Waiting for Wails v3 release_
    - [Wails v3 Status](https://v3alpha.wails.io/status/)
    - [GitHub Issue #1178](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/1178)

## 🎨 Frontend
- **Implement Skeleton UI Toolkit**
  _Waiting for Tailwind V4 support_
    - [Skeleton Labs PR #3189](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/pull/3189)

## 🐍 Python
- Streaming the Device Display instead of taking screenshots should be doable using `adb shell screenrecord`  
  Currently it takes like 100-200ms to take a screenshot, streaming at 15 FPS would already make it as low as 67ms and 30 FPS as low as 33ms.  
  If this is done it could make something like a Fishing Bot more reasonable to implement.
