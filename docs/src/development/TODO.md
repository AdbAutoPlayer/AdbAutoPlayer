## üîß Backend Development

### Android Multi-Touch Gesture Implementation (PoC)
**Library:** [uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2)

**Challenge:**  
ADB lacks native multi-touch gesture support. uiautomator2 offers:
- Coordinate-based tapping (`d.click(x, y)`)
- Screenshot capture (`d.screenshot()`)
- Advanced gestures (swipe, pinch, etc.)

**Goals:**
- Develop PoC for multi-touch gestures
- Prioritize pinch-to-zoom for game automation

**Extended Opportunities:**
1. Explore additional uiautomator2 game automation features
2. Performance comparison: uiautomator2 vs standard ADB
3. Benchmark tests for shared functionality (tap, screenshot, swipe)

### Desktop Client Support Investigation

**Current Understanding:**
1. Mouse click simulation limitations (requires actual cursor movement)
2. Screenshot challenges with display scaling/multi-monitor setups
3. Higher detection risk compared to ADB (if Lilith starts to care about botting)

**Implementation Needs:**
1. Device abstraction layer (Android vs Desktop)
2. Unified input mapping system
   ```python
   # The actual bot code should not end up looking like this.
   if device.platform == "Android":
   device.press_back_button()
   elif device.platform == "DesktopApp":
   device.keyboard.press("ESC")
   ```
3. Complete desktop interaction logic
