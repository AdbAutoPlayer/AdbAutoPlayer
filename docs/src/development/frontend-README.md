## Svelte with SvelteKit and Skeleton
This project is built using [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction#What-is-Svelte) with [**SvelteKit**](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction#What-is-SvelteKit).  
We also use [**Skeleton**](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started/introduction) (soon not yet actually), a UI toolkit for Svelte, to help with styling and components.

## Setup
Follow the [Go Setup](go-README.md#setup)

## Contributing
Nothing here yetâ€”I would appreciate PRs since I am not very good at this.  
I do insist on using **Svelte**, as this is the only frontend framework that I have even the tiniest amount of success with and feel comfortable maintaining.  
Other than that, if you are interested in helping out, you can do whatever you want, and you have my full support.
