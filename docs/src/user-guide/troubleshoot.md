# Troubleshooting

## General try disabling Device Stream
If Device Streaming is active try unchecking it and see if your problem goes away.  
If your problem does NOT go away activate it again.

## Emulator
> [!NOTE]
> Test both [MumuPlayer](https://www.mumuplayer.com/) and [BlueStacks 5](https://www.bluestacks.com/)

## This bot only works in Portrait mode
1. Please double-check your [Emulator Settings](emulator-settings.md).  
2. If the game automatically switches to Landscape on start, use the Rotate Menu and select Portrait.

## Missing files
This issue usually occurs due to one of the following reasons:

1. **Windows Security or another Antivirus software flagged a false positive** and deleted/quarantined one or more files. Learn more about [false positives](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/false-positive).
2. **An error occurred during the update process**, preventing all files from being properly installed.
3. **You didnâ€™t extract all files from the .zip** or moved the **.exe** to a different directory, causing missing dependencies.

Make sure to extract all files and check your antivirus settings to prevent accidental deletions. 

## File contains a virus or potentially unwanted software
1. Search **Windows Security**

2. Select **Virus & threat protection**

3. Click **allowed threats**

4. Search for a Threat that has **AdbAutoPlayer** or **adb_auto_player** in the file name or path then click **Actions** and **Restore**

5. If you have no Threats click **Protection history** and check there then do the same as step 4.

Some games will not automatically scale when the resolution changes. You simply have to press the button and the bot will work.
