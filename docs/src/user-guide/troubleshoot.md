1. Open the `main_config.toml` file in the **AdbAutoPlayer_MacOS** directory.  
2. Locate the `id` field and update the value with the device ID visible in the logs (the first device shown in green).
3. Save the file and click **Reload main_config.toml** in the app.

### MacOS
- Ensure **ADB Debugging** is enabled in **MuMuPlayer Pro** as described above.  
- If **AdbAutoPlayer** doesn't work, verify:
  - The correct device ID is set in `main_config.toml`.
  - ADB is installed and configured (`adb devices` lists your emulator).
