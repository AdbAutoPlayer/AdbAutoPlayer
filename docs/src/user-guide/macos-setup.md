## Installation Steps

### 1. **Download the App**
- Get the latest release of **AdbAutoPlayer**:
  [AdbAutoPlayer_MacOS.zip](https://github.com/yulesxoxo/AdbAutoPlayer/releases/latest).
- Extract the `.zip` file to a folder on your computer.

### 2. **Install Homebrew**
- Follow the instructions at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) to install **Homebrew**, a package manager for macOS.
- Check if there are Warnings in the output  
Example:
![brew_warning_next_steps.png](../images/macos/brew_warning_next_steps.png)
In this case just follow what it says in Next steps: on the screenshot. Copy and paste the commands one by one.

- Make sure brew is installed
  In your Terminal input:
  ```bash
  brew -v
  ```
  if correctly installed you will get output like this:
  ```text
  Homebrew 4.4.21-68-ge7a7410
  Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 2a1608c9f63; last commit 2025-02-20)
  ```

### 3. **Install ADB via Homebrew**
- Use Homebrew to install the Android Debug Bridge (ADB):
  ```bash
  brew install --cask android-platform-tools
  ```
- Make sure adb is installed
  In your Terminal input:
  ```bash
  adb version
  ```
  if correctly installed you will get output like this:
  ```text
  Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
  Version 35.0.2-12147458
  Installed as /opt/homebrew/bin/adb
  Running on Darwin 24.2.0 (arm64)
  ```

## Starting AdbAutoPlayer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you started the App before installing Brew and ADB you need to restart it.

macOS may block the app because it lacks a code signing certificate. Here's how to open it:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will happen after every update.


1. Double-click the app. You'll see this prompt:
   ![Blocked Prompt](../images/macos/not_opened.png)  
   Click **Done**.

2. Go to **System Settings** â†’ **Privacy & Security**, scroll to the bottom, and find:  
   ![Blocked by macOS](../images/macos/was_blocked_to_protect_your_mac.png)  
   Click **Open Anyway** and keep this open you will need it again later.

3. Double-click the app again. If prompted, click **Open Anyway** again:  
   ![Open AdbAutoPlayer](../images/macos/open_adb_auto_player.png)

4. If you see this security prompt:  
   ![Security Prompt](../images/macos/privacy_and_security.png)  
   Use your Touch ID or password.

5. The app will open a Terminal window. Leave it open and use the GUI
6. When you click any action button on the App you will get another blocked prompt:  
   ![Open AdbAutoPlayer](../images/macos/python_app_blocked.png)  
    Repeat Step 2 and try clicking the button again.

## Disable Security (Optional not recommended)

The security prompt from the previous step can be really annoying and will happen on every update. If you want a workaround you can try typing this into terminal:
```shell
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
This will add the option to allow apps from anywhere:
