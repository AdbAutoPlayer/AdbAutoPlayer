## Starting AdbAutoPlayer

macOS may block the app because it lacks a code signing certificate. Here's how to open it:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will happen after every update.


1. Double-click the app. You'll see this prompt:
   ![Blocked Prompt](../images/macos/not_opened.png)
   Click **Done**.

2. Go to **System Settings** â†’ **Privacy & Security**, scroll to the bottom, and find:
   ![Blocked by macOS](../images/macos/was_blocked_to_protect_your_mac.png)
   Click **Open Anyway** and keep this open you will need it again later.

3. Double-click the app again. If prompted, click **Open Anyway** again:
   ![Open AdbAutoPlayer](../images/macos/open_adb_auto_player.png)

4. If you see this security prompt:
   ![Security Prompt](../images/macos/privacy_and_security.png)
   Use your Touch ID or password.

5. The app will open a Terminal window. Leave it open and use the GUI
6. When you click any action button on the App you will get another blocked prompt:
   ![Open AdbAutoPlayer](../images/macos/python_app_blocked.png)
    Repeat Step 2 and try clicking the button again.

## Disable Security (Optional not recommended)

The security prompt from the previous step can be really annoying and will happen on every update. If you want a workaround you can try typing this into terminal:
```shell
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
This will add the option to allow apps from anywhere:
