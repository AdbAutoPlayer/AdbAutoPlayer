# Linux Setup Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Linux is **not officially supported**.  
> None of the maintainers use Linux, and we **do not provide Linux builds, troubleshooting, or assistance**.

## If You Still Want to Try:

1. **Build It Yourself**
    - You can try following the [Dev & Build](../development/dev-and-build.md) guide.
    - **No support will be provided**—you’re on your own.
    - Functionality is **not guaranteed**, and you may encounter Linux-specific issues.

2. **Contribute Proper Support**
    - If you’re willing to **maintain Linux builds, fix issues, and document setup**, contact us.
    - Without an active Linux maintainer, official support **will never happen**.

**We will not answer questions about Linux builds.** Check back if community contributions change this in the future.
