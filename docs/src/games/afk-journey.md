## In-Game Recommended Settings  

To improve performance and reduce lag, adjust the following in-game settings:  

- Set Graphics to **Minimum** while keeping high-performance **Power Mode**.  
- **Disable Battle Texts**: Go to `Battle > Combat Text > Off`. This prevents excessive on-screen text, reducing emulator lag.  
- **Disable Battle Logs**: Under Combat Text, turning off battle logs minimizes post-battle processing and improves overall game performance.
