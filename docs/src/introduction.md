# Introduction
AdbAutoPlayer exists to automate boring tasks and dailies in games I play.

It's only tested on Windows using [LDPlayer](https://www.ldplayer.net/)  
I have tried it once on an Apple M1 Max using [MuMuPlayer Pro](https://www.mumuplayer.com/mac/)  
While it should work on Apple Silicon I do not plan to officially support it or deal with any issues personally.
